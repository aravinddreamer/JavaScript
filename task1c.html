<h3>Task1-Median</h3>
<pre>
	Array Middle Value (AMV) is a middle value(s) in the set of integers.
	 The set should have at least three unique values . 
	 For example, AMV in 10, 4, 8 is 8 as it is middle among the three numbers by its face value.
	  AMV in 8, 6, 7, 9 are 7 & 8 as there is no unique single middle value.
	   8, 2 does't have any AMV as it has only two unique values. 
	   Write a program to print the AMV and their index in a given set of integers.
