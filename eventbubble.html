	<h1>Event</h1>
	<pre>
		Event is the act of perfoming.
		There are different way of flow of event.
		I.Bubbling
		II.Capturing
		III.Target
	</pre>
	Event's bubble,capture occur in nested blocks.
	so that clicking of inner/outer division produces different actions.
<h2>Event Bubbling</h2>
	<pre>
		Event bubbling occurs when class is triggred.
		It works in a way that from the current element to the outermost parent node.
		
	<img src="img/bubble.png" alt="picture bubble">

		If an event Ex:onclick of button ocurrs it triggers all parent nodes.
		From button --> div --> div
		This process of flow can be modified by using stop.propagation
	
		In the above displayed code.There is outer divsion,inner Division and at the depth is the button.
		All nodes are nested one inside the another.
		Script is written at the bottom of the HTML.
		Using query selector the nodes elements are obtained.
		The last is the actionListener which performs actions when the event occurs in the respective node.
	</pre>
	<div id="bubbleOuter" >
		<div id="bubbleInner" >
			<button id="bubbleButt">Click me for bubbling event</button>
		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Event Capturing</h2>
	<pre>
		Event Capturing occurs when class is triggred same as bubbling.
		It works in a way that from current element to the inner most node.
	<img style="margin-left: 20%" src="img/capturehtml.png" alt="picture capture">	
	<img src="img/capturescript.png" alt="picture capture">

		If an event Ex:onclick of inner division ocurrs it triggers all its child nodes.
		From : div --> div --> button
		This process of flow can be modified manually by using addActionlistoner with third parameter as true.
	
		In the above displayed code.There is outer divsion,inner Division and at the depth is the button.
		All nodes are nested one inside the another.
		Using query selector the nodes elements are obtained.
		The last is the actionListener which performs actions when the event occurs in the respective node.
	</pre>
	<div id="capturingOuter" >
		<div id="capturingInner" >
			<button id="capturingButt">Click me for Capture event</button>
		</div>
	</div>
<h2>Target Event</h2>
	<pre>
		Event target occurs and gives result of only the current element.
		Only actioned element is processed remaining bubble and capture are stopped.
		Ihis is done using <h3>event.stopPropagation</h3>.
		Which stop remaining action even when it is nested.
		
	<img src="img/stopPropagation.png" alt="picture target">

		If an event Ex:onclick of button .Only it's alert box is displayed.
		This process of flow is be modified by using stop.propagation.
	
		In the above displayed code.There is outer divsion,inner Division and at the depth is the button.
		All nodes are nested one inside the another.
		Using query selector the nodes elements are obtained.
		The last is the actionListener which performs actions when the event occurs in the respective node.
	</pre>
	<div id="stopOuter" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" >
		<div id="stopInner" onclick="event.stopPropagation()">
			<button id="stopButt" onclick="event.stopPropagation()">Click me for Target event</button>
		</div>
	</div>
