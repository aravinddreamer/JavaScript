How are the local and session storage stored in browser ?
	
	Both are client side storage.
	It is stored in native directory of the web browser.
	In encrypted format.
	For different brower different directory.
	Which stores their current log,old log,history,session storage and local storage in encrypted format.
	Ex:
		.ldb
		.log
		.localstorage
		.txt
		.db
		.sk -history
		.plist -property list
	As http is stateless ,local storage is used.
	That is when an application is used and closed.
	It is completely reset.
	It forces the user to login again once.
	So that local storage and cookies are used wich stored keys and other infomations.
